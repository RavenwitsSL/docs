# Getting Started

This section explains how to access the Ravenwits customer platform: the **web portal** and the **API**.

## Accessing the web portal

The Ravenwits web portal is available at **[https://portal.ravenwits.com](https://portal.ravenwits.com)**. Open this URL in your browser to sign in and use the dashboard.

- **Sign in**: Use the email and password provided by your account administrator.
- **Dashboard**: After signing in, you can view your strategies, submit or track purchases, and see forecasts.
- **Support**: If you don’t have login details, contact [Ravenwits support](mailto:info@ravenwits.com) or your account manager.

No installation is required—everything runs in the browser.

## Accessing the API

The Ravenwits API is available at **[https://api.ravenwits.com](https://api.ravenwits.com)**. All API requests use this base URL.

- **Authentication**: To call the API, you first sign in with your email and password to obtain a **token**. You then send this token with each request. See [API Usage – Authentication](/api-usage/authentication) for details.
- **Documentation**: The full list of endpoints, parameters, and examples is in the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview). You can try requests from the reference or with tools like Postman or curl.

Your account manager or support can confirm that your account has API access enabled.

## Next steps

- Read [Authentication](/api-usage/authentication) to understand how to get and use your API token.
- Browse the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview) to see all available endpoints and try them in the playground.
