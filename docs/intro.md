# Welcome to Ravenwits

This documentation helps you get started with the Ravenwits customer platform. Whether you prefer the **web portal** or the **API**, you’ll find everything you need here.

## What is the Ravenwits customer platform?

The platform gives you access to your strategies, purchase submission, and forecasts. You can:

- **Use the web portal** at **[portal.ravenwits.com](https://portal.ravenwits.com)** to sign in, view dashboards, manage strategies, submit and track purchases, and see forecasts—all in your browser.
- **Use the API** at **api.ravenwits.com** to integrate with your own systems, automate workflows, or build custom tools. All API requests go to **https://api.ravenwits.com**.

Your account (email and password) works for both the portal and the API. You sign in once to get a token, then use that token for API calls or stay logged in on the portal.

## Documentation overview

- **[Getting Started](/getting-started)** — How to access the web portal and the API. No technical setup required.
- **[API Usage](/api-usage/authentication)** — How authentication works so you can call the API securely.
- **[API Reference](/api-reference/overview)** — Full list of endpoints, request and response formats, and a playground to try requests.
